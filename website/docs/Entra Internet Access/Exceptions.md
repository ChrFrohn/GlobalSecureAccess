## POC scenario: Allow a user to access a blocked website

In some cases, you might have users that require access to blocked sites for groups in which the user is a member. Complete the following tasks to override a block configured for your test group, so the test user can access the blocked site.

- Configure an allow rule for the same FQDN that you blocked in the previous scenario. [Create a web filtering policy](#create-a-web-filtering-policy).
- Group and prioritize your web filtering policies. [Create a security profile](#create-a-security-policy-profile) with a higher priority than the block policy created previously.
- Configure your test user to use the security profile. [Create and assign a Conditional Access policy](#create-a-conditional-access-policy).
- Confirm rule application by using your test user to [attempt to access a blocked site](#attempt-to-access-blocked-sites) that is now allowed for the user.
- [View activity in the traffic log](#view-activity-in-the-traffic-log).
