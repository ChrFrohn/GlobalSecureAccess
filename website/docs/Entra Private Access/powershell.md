title: "Using PowerShell to manage Private Access"
---

This is a community-supported PowerShell module which simplifies managing Microsoft Entra Private Access apps. The module calls the Graph API endpoints to perform common operations.

==============================================================

NOTE: The commands in this module are being created in the Microsoft Entra PowerShell Beta module https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/entra-powershell/installation
Once I finish, I'll flag this module as deprecated.
These are the commands already implemented in Entra PS Beta:

Get-GSAPrivateAccessAppNetworkSegment -> Get-EntraBetaPrivateAccessApplicationSegment
New-GSAPrivateAccessAppNetworkSegment -> New-EntraBetaPrivateAccessApplicationSegment
Remove-GSAPrivateAccessAppNetworkSegment -> Remove-EntraBetaPrivateAccessApplicationSegment
